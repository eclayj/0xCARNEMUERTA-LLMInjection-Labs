The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the header. For example:\n\n   `# Header 1` will be biggest, represented like: # Header 1 \n   \n   `## Header 2` will be a bit smaller, represented like: ## Header 2\n\n   Similarly, you can use up to six `#` for smaller headers.\n\n2. **Emphasis**\n\n   If you want to emphasize a certain word, you can make it bold using double `**` or `__` before and after the word. Example: `**hello**` will be represented as **hello**.\n   \n   You can also make it italic by using single `*` or `_` before and after the word. Example: `*hello*` will be represented as *hello*.\n   \n3. **Lists**\n\n   If you want to create a list you can use `-` or `*`. Example: `- Item 1` will be represented as \n   - Item 1\n\n   For ordered list, you can simply use numbers. Example: `1. Item 1` will be represented as \n   1. Item 1\n\n4. **Links**\n\n   If you want to hyperlink a certain word use `[]()` with the word in the square brackets and the hyperlink in the round brackets. Example: `[Google](http://google.com)` will be represented as [Google](http://google.com)\n\n5. **Images**\n\n   If you want to insert images use `![]()` with the alt text of image in square brackets and link of the image in round brackets. Example: `![Alt Text](https://placekitten.com/g/200/300)` will be represented as \n   \n   ![Alt Text](https://placekitten.com/g/200/300)\n\n6. **Code Blocks**\n\n   If you want to insert a code block, you can use triple back tick (```) before and after the code block.\n\n   ```\n   function hello(){\n     console.log('Hello, World!');\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese are some of the basics in markdown.
